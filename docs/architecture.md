# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The FinTech AI Platform is built on a cloud-native, microservices architecture that addresses the traditional challenges in banking systems through modern technologies and AI-first design principles.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Customer Management Domain**: Handles customer onboarding, KYC, and profile management
- **Risk & Compliance Domain**: Credit scoring, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance
- **Payment Processing Domain**: Payment execution, settlement, and notifications
- **AI/ML Domain**: Model serving, predictions, and feature management

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Async Communication**: Services communicate through Kafka event streams
- **Event Sourcing**: Audit trails and event replay capabilities
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for scalability

### 3. BIAN Alignment
The platform implements core BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network) service domains:

#### Customer Management
- Customer Directory
- Customer Profile
- Customer Behavior Models

#### Risk & Compliance
- Credit Risk Assessment
- Fraud Detection
- Regulatory Compliance

#### Payment Services
- Payment Initiation
- Payment Execution
- Settlement

## Technology Stack

### Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio (optional)
- **API Gateway**: Kong/Custom Express.js Gateway
- **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes Ingress

### Microservices
- **API Gateway**: Node.js/Express - Entry point and routing
- **Customer Service**: Node.js/Express - Customer management and KYC
- **Risk Service**: Python/FastAPI - Risk assessment and compliance
- **Payment Service**: Go - Payment processing and settlement
- **ML Service**: Python/FastAPI - AI/ML model serving
- **Feature Store**: Python/FastAPI - Feature engineering and data

### Data Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (per service)
- **Cache**: Redis (session, rate limiting)
- **Message Streaming**: Apache Kafka
- **Data Lake**: S3/MinIO (for analytics)

### AI/ML Stack
- **Model Training**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Model Serving**: TensorFlow Serving, MLflow
- **Feature Store**: Custom solution with PostgreSQL
- **MLOps**: Automated training and deployment pipelines

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger (distributed tracing)
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Model
- **Service-to-Service**: Mutual TLS authentication
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with short expiration
- **Network Security**: Service mesh policies

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth2/OIDC**: For external integrations
- **JWT**: For internal service communication
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control
- **ABAC**: Attribute-based access control for fine-grained permissions

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database and file system encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Kubernetes secrets, external secret operators
- **PII Protection**: Data masking and anonymization

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
- **Load Distribution**: Service mesh load balancing
- **Database Sharding**: Customer-based sharding strategy

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (Redis, CDN, service-level)
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection optimization
- **Async Processing**: Event-driven processing for non-critical operations

### Availability
- **Multi-Region**: Active-active deployment across regions
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fail-fast patterns for service resilience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for service failures

## Data Architecture

### Data Mesh Principles
1. **Domain Ownership**: Each domain owns its data
2. **Data as a Product**: Self-serve data infrastructure
3. **Federated Governance**: Decentralized data management
4. **Self-Serve Platform**: Automated data pipeline creation

### Data Flow
```
Customer Interactions → API Gateway → Services → Kafka → Data Lake
                                         ↓
Event Sourcing → Database → Feature Store → ML Models → Predictions
```

### Real-time Analytics
- **Stream Processing**: Kafka Streams for real-time analytics
- **Batch Processing**: Spark for historical analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Real-time and batch feature computation

## Deployment Strategy

### GitOps
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for cloud resources
- **Configuration Management**: Kubernetes manifests in Git
- **Continuous Deployment**: ArgoCD/Flux for GitOps workflows

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Local Docker Compose
- **Staging**: Kubernetes cluster (scaled down)
- **Production**: Multi-region Kubernetes clusters

### Release Management
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual traffic shifting
- **Feature Flags**: A/B testing and gradual rollouts

## Compliance & Governance

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR**: Data privacy and right to be forgotten
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data security
- **SOX**: Financial reporting compliance
- **Basel III**: Banking regulatory framework

### Data Governance
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow and transformations
- **Data Quality**: Automated data validation and monitoring
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit logs for compliance

### Model Governance
- **Model Registry**: Version control for ML models
- **Model Validation**: A/B testing and performance monitoring
- **Bias Detection**: Automated bias testing and reporting

## Integration Patterns

### Internal Integration
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka for async communication
